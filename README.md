# EV Finder

A full-stack app built with React that helps users find the right full-electric vehicle for them. Users can take a questionnaire, browse vehicles, or compare two side-by-side.

## Introduction

After completing my [previous app](https://github.com/dylanhamada/blog-project), which focused on combining React with HTTP requests to a database, I decided to build a new app to implement what I learned about React-Router and Redux.

In the previous year, I had purchased a new car, and wished there was an app to help me find and compare potential candidates. Eventually this became the kernel of an app idea, with a focus on electric vehicles.

## Project Status

The app is in its early planning stages. I am currently deliberating on app functionality and beginning an early wireframe.

The [current iteration](https://excalidraw.com/#json=6296466674941952,8pC8afHzJSAaJ_14l3oL7Q) of the wireframe can be viewed on Excalidraw.

A record of notable changes can be found in the CHANGELOG file.

## App Overview

1. A questionnaire that provides users with a vehicle recommendation

   2. Secondary recommendations available
2. Vehicle browser with various filters
   1. Vehicles can be selected and their relevant info displayed

## Technologies

I plan to use the following tech stack:
